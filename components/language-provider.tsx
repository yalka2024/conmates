    "breakdown.clause.rent.explanation": "You'll pay $2,400 every month, and it's due on the 1st. If you're late (after the 5th), you'll be charged a $75 late fee. This is pretty standard, but the late fee is on the higher side.",

    "breakdown.clause.deposit.explanation": "You're putting down $2,400 as a security deposit (same as one month's rent). This money protects the landlord if you damage the place, don't pay rent, or leave it messy. You should get most or all of it back if you take good care of the apartment.",

    "breakdown.clause.maintenance.explanation": "Your landlord has to keep the place livable (working heat, plumbing, etc.), but you're responsible for small fixes under $100. If something major breaks, you need to tell them within 2 days or you might be held responsible.",
    "breakdown.clause.maintenance.tip1": "Report issues immediately via email to create a paper trail",
    "breakdown.clause.maintenance.tip2": "Keep receipts for any repairs you make under $100",

    "breakdown.clause.subletting.originalText": "Tenant may not assign this lease or sublet the premises, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Landlord. Any unauthorized assignment or subletting shall be grounds for immediate termination.",
    "breakdown.clause.subletting.explanation": "You can't let someone else live there or take over your lease without your landlord's written permission. If you do it anyway, they can kick you out immediately. This limits your flexibility if your situation changes.",

    "breakdown.clause.rent.explanation": "You'll pay $2,400 every month, and it's due on the 1st. If you're late (after the 5th), you'll be charged a $75 late fee. This is pretty standard, but the late fee is on the higher side.",

    "breakdown.clause.deposit.explanation": "You're putting down $2,400 as a security deposit (same as one month's rent). This money protects the landlord if you damage the place, don't pay rent, or leave it messy. You should get most or all of it back if you take good care of the apartment.",

    "breakdown.clause.subletting.originalText": "Tenant may not assign this lease or sublet the premises, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Landlord. Any unauthorized assignment or subletting shall be grounds for immediate termination.",
    "breakdown.clause.subletting.explanation": "You can't let someone else live there or take over your lease without your landlord's written permission. If you do it anyway, they can kick you out immediately. This limits your flexibility if your situation changes.",
